1. Define header and main in your document;

2. Place a search-bar at the center of your header:
when nothing is typed in the search-bar, it should display a text saying "Search article..." in light-blue color
remember the method: is it a POST or GET?
Add a button next to the search-bar with "Search written in it";

3. In the main create a form for uploading an article. It must have the following inputs
a required input for the headline. It must be at least 15 char long and at most 30 long
an optional input for the second headline. It must be at least 15 char long and at most 50 long
a required textarea for the text. The text must be at least 40 caracthers long and at most 300 caracthers long
an optional input for uploading multiple images (note: only images)	
a button for submitting the form.
	
Optional:
Invalid inputs must be given a red-ish background.
focused elements must have a 3px black border
remember the method: is it a POST or GET?
Add a required input for a password. Pattern: it must be at least 5 characthers long, have 1 number, 1 uppercase and 1 lowercase letter
Using inline-block for the labels, have the inputs be aligned starting from the same position (see Lessons repo)
